**Automated Spam Email Detection and Visualization**  

This project utilizes **UiPath**, a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tool, to automate the detection, categorization, and visualization of spam emails. It addresses challenges associated with increasing email volumes, cluttered inboxes, and inefficient manual spam management.  

### **Key Highlights**  

1. **Technologies and Tools Used**  
   - **UiPath**: For designing automation workflows.  
   - **Excel**: To log email data and create visual trends.  
   - **IMAP Protocol**: Securely retrieve emails.  
   - **Data Structures**: Dictionaries to track email frequency by sender.  

2. **Problem Statement**  
   - Managing email overload is challenging with growing volumes.  
   - Manual spam detection is time-intensive, error-prone, and inefficient.  
   - Lack of detailed insights into sender trends affects decision-making.  

3. **Proposed Solution**  
   - Developed an automated workflow using UiPath to segregate spam and regular emails.  
   - Retrieved emails securely using IMAP and logged metadata (sender and frequency) into Excel.  
   - Designed charts and graphs to visualize email activity, providing clear insights into sender behavior and spam trends.  

4. **Outcome**  
   - **Streamlined Management**: Automated categorization reduced manual effort.  
   - **Enhanced Insights**: Visualizations offered actionable trends for improved inbox organization.  
   - **Scalable System**: Adaptable to personal and professional email use cases, making it suitable for diverse applications.  

### **Conclusion**  
This project demonstrates the power of RPA in optimizing email workflows. By automating repetitive tasks like spam detection, it minimizes human intervention, improves productivity, and provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making. Future enhancements could include refining spam detection algorithms for better accuracy and incorporating an unsubscribe feature for managing unwanted communications more effectively.  

With a robust and adaptable design, this solution serves as a foundation for modern email management, empowering users to handle large volumes of email data effortlessly while maintaining security and efficiency.
